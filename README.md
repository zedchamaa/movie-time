<h2>The challenge</h2>

<p>
  Your challenge is to build out this entertainment web application and get it
  looking as close to the design as possible.
</p>

<p>
  You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if
  you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
</p>

<p>
  We provide the data in a local `data.json` file, so use that to populate the
  content on the first load. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to
  build this as a full-stack application!
</p>

<p>Your users should be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
  </li>
  <li>See hover states for all interactive elements on the page</li>
  <li>Navigate between Home, Movies, TV Series, and Bookmarked Shows pages</li>
  <li>Add/Remove bookmarks from all movies and TV series</li>
  <li>Search for relevant shows on all pages</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Bonus:</strong> Build this project as a full-stack application
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Bonus:</strong> If you're building a full-stack app, we provide
    authentication screen (sign-up/login) designs if you'd like to create an
    auth flow
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Expected Behavior</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>General</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The navigation menu should be fixed to the left for larger screens. Use
        the "Desktop - Home" page in the design as a visual reference.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Home</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The trending section should scroll sideways to reveal other trending
        shows
      </li>
      <li>
        Any search input should search through all shows (i.e. all movies and TV
        series)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Movies</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This page should only display shows with the "Movie" category</li>
      <li>Any search input should search through all movies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>TV Series</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This page should only display shows with the "TV Series" category</li>
      <li>Any search input should search through all TV series</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Bookmarked Shows</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This page should display all bookmarked shows from both categories
      </li>
      <li>Any search input should search through all bookmarked shows</li>
    </ul>
